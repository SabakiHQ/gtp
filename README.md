# @sabaki/gtp [![CI](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/gtp/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/gtp/actions)

A Node.js module for handling GTP engines.

## Installation

Use npm to install:

```
$ npm install @sabaki/gtp
```

## Usage

### Controller Usage

Use the [`Controller`](#controller) class to interact with an engine:

```js
const {StreamController, Controller, Command, Response} = require('@sabaki/gtp')

async function main() {
  let leela = new Controller('./path/to/leela', ['--gtp', '--noponder'])
  leela.start()

  let response = null

  try {
    response = await leela.sendCommand({name: 'genmove', args: ['B']})
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error('Failed to send command!')
  }

  if (response.error) {
    throw new Error('Command not understood by Leela!')
  }

  console.log(response.content)
  await leela.stop()
}

main().catch(err => console.log(`Error: ${err}`))
```

### Engine Usage

Use the [`Engine`](#engine) class to create an engine:

```js
const {Engine} = require('@sabaki/gtp')

let testEngine = new Engine('Test Engine', '0.1')

testEngine.command('play', (command, out) => {
  if (command.args.length === 0) return out.err('player not specified')
  out.send('playing for ' + command.args[0])
})

testEngine.start()
```

## API

### `Command`

A GTP command is represented by an object of the following form:

```js
{
  id?: <Integer> | null,
  name: <String>,
  args?: <String[]>
}
```

#### `Command.fromString(input)`

- `input` `<String>` - The GTP command as string, e.g. `1 genmove B`

Returns a `Command` object, representing `input`.

#### `Command.toString(command)`

- `command` [`<Command>`](#command)

Returns a GTP command string represented by `command` to be sent to an engine.

---

### `Response`

A response from a GTP engine is represented by an object of the following form:

```js
{
  id?: <Integer> | null,
  content: <String>,
  error?: <Boolean>
}
```

#### `Response.fromString(input)`

- `input` `<String>` - The GTP response as string, e.g. `=1 ok`

Returns a `Response` object, representing `input`.

#### `Response.toString(response)`

- `response` [`<Response>`](#response)

Returns a GTP response string represented by `response`, something that an
engine might send.

---

### `class StreamController extends EventEmitter`

Use this class to control GTP engines on arbitrary communication channels. To
spawn engine processes automatically, use [`Controller`](#controller).

#### `new StreamController(input, output)`

- `input`
  [`<Writable>`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable)
- `output`
  [`<Readable>`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable)

#### Event: `command-sent`

- `evt` `<Object>`
  - `command` [`<Command>`](#command)
  - `subscribe(subscriber)`
  - `async getResponse()` [`<Response>`](#response)

This event is emitted when a command is sent to the engine. Using the
`subscribe` function you can get updates every time the engine responds with a
new line, see
[streamController.sendCommand()](#async-streamcontrollersendcommandcommand-subscriber).

#### Event: `response-received`

- `evt` `<Object>`
  - `command` [`<Command>`](#command)
  - `response` [`<Response>`](#response)

This event is emitted when the engine finishes sending a response.

#### `streamController.input`

[`<Writable>`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable) -
The input stream of the GTP engine.

#### `streamController.output`

[`<Readable>`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) -
The output stream of the GTP engine.

#### `streamController.commands`

[`<Command[]>`](#command) - The command queue.

#### `streamController.busy`

`<Boolean>` - Indicates whether the controller is waiting for an engine response
or not.

#### `async streamController.sendCommand(command[, subscriber])`

- `command` [`<Command>`](#command)
- `subscriber` `<Function>` _(optional)_
  - `evt` `<Object>`

Sends a command to the engine and returns a [response object](#response). You
can pass a `subscriber` function to get updates every time the engine responds
with a new line. `subscriber` is called with an object `evt` with the following
properties:

- `line` `<String>` - The contents of the incoming line.
- `end` `<Boolean>` - `true` if incoming line is the last line of response.
- `command` [`<Command>`](#command) - The command to which the response belongs.
- `response` [`<Response>`](#response) - The partial response until now,
  including the incoming line with all the previous lines.

#### `streamController.close()`

Cleans up listeners.

---

### `class Controller extends EventEmitter`

#### Event: `started`

This event is emitted when the engine process starts.

#### Event: `stopped`

- `evt` `<Object>`
  - `signal` `<String>` - The signal by which the engine process was terminated.

This event is emitted after the engine process ends.

#### Event: `stderr`

- `evt` `<Object>`

### `class ControllerStateTracker`

Use this class to keep track of the state of an engine. This class is also able
to synchronize the state of an engine to a given state.

#### `EngineState`

The state of an engine is represented by an object of the following structure:

```js
{
  komi: <number | null>,
  boardsize: <[number, number] | null>,
  history: <Command[] | null>
}
```

- Values will be `null` if we do not know the engine state.
- `boardsize` contains the width and height of the board.
- `history` is an array of `set_free_handicap` and `play` [commands](#command).

#### `new ControllerStateTracker(controller)`

- `controller` [`<StreamController>`](#streamcontroller) or
  [`<Controller>`](#controller)

#### `ControllerStateTracker.fromStreamController(input, output)`

Equivalent to `new ControllerStateTracker(new StreamController(input, output))`.

#### `ControllerStateTracker.fromController(path[, args[, spawnOptions]])`

Equivalent to
`new ControllerStateTracker(new Controller(path, args, spawnOptions))`.

#### `stateTracker.controller`

[`<StreamController>`](#streamcontroller) or [`<Controller>`](#controller) - The
controller of the engine that we're tracking the state of.

#### `stateTracker.state`

[`<EngineState>`](#enginestate) - The state of the engine controlled by
[`stateTracker.controller`](#statetrackercontroller).

#### `stateTracker.syncing`

- `commandName` `<String>`

Returns a boolean whether the engine supports the given command.

#### `async stateTracker.sync(state)`

- `state` [`<EngineState>`](#enginestate)

Tries to sync the engine to the given `state`. Omit keys or set values to `null`
in the `state` object if you do not want to change the engine state for
particular keys.
